# WaterWarning
**Features**
- Toggles all your hanging red lanterns on a 1 second interval, while the boat's water level is above the configured threshold (75% by default)
- Can be configured to also affect lanterns that are *not* on hooks, though it will still exclude ones in your hand or inventory (having the light you're holding blink was too weird)
- Can also be configured to only affect 1 boat at a time, in case it somehow ends up being a performance issue
